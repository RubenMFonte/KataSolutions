- Exercise 1 (Two Sum)

  Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests) and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that, when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items should then be returned in a tuple like so: (index1, index2).

  For the purposes of this kata, some tests may have multiple answers; any valid solutions will be accepted.

  The input will always be valid (numbers will be an array of length 2 or greater, and all of the items will be numbers; target will always be the sum of two different items from that array).


- Exercise 2 (The Supermarket Queue)

  There is a queue for the self-checkout tills at the supermarket. Your task is write a function to calculate the total time required for all the customers to check out!

  input
  customers: an array of positive integers representing the queue. Each integer represents a customer, and its value is the amount of time they require to check out.
  n: a positive integer, the number of checkout tills.
  output
  The function should return an integer, the total time required.


- Exercise 3 (Digital Root)

  In this kata, you must create a digital root function.

  A digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number. Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. This is only applicable to the natural numbers.
